// ctrl + forward slash to comment and uncomment all the selected parts and to run the code in terminal node space then filename(node test1conditions.js)
//and declaring is basically becomes the input later in the procees so you should more focus on the if conditions.. and the function more than anything
// x=3 , is saying 3 is put in storage called x, but x==3 means x is equal to 3 literally same as x=3 in normal mathematics




// 1) Three is not bigger than thirty-three”
//(3!>33)~(3<33), declare variable 

//let a = 3;
//let b = 33

//if (a<b){
   
    //console.log("true")
//}else{
   // console.log("false")
//}


// 2) “Twenty-four divided by six is four”
//24/6=4 , declare variable 

//let a= 24
//let b=6

//console.log(a/b)


// 3) “Eight is larger than seven and smaller than ten”
// 8>7 and 8<10, declare variables

//let a=8
//let b=7
//let c=10

//if ((a>b)&&(a<c)){
  //  console.log ("true")
//}else{
  //  console.log("False")
//}



// 4) “‘Coding” comes before “Programming” (in the alphabet) and 2023 comes before 2024 (in numbers)”
// declare variables 

//let a = "Coding"
//let b= "Programmming"

//and

//let c= 2023
//let d= 2024

//if ((a<b)&&(c<2024)) {

  //  console.log("hey hey")
//}

//Simple If Statement
//"If the user is logged in, show the homepage."

// let userLoggedIn = true

// if(userLoggedIn){
//   console.log("Show the homepage/ Welcome to the homepage!")
// }

//If-Else Statement
//"If the temperature is above 30 degrees, display 'Hot'; otherwise, display 'Cold'."
//declare variables, then conditions

/// In an if statement:

//The if checks the first condition.
//the else if checks additional conditions if the first one isn’t true.
//The else doesn’t check anything—it just runs whatever code is inside it when all the other conditions are false.
//Sometimes, using else can be risky because it might handle unexpected cases in a way you don’t want. To avoid mistakes, it’s better to use more else if conditions to clearly handle each possible case. You can leave the else only for truly invalid or unexpected situations.

//Important thing= for Any statment, in the if conditions if its out side it be like numbers or strings it is considered "True" and if it is null is connsidered "false"
// let temperature= 35

// if(temperature>30){
//   console.log("hot")
// }else {
//   console.log("Cold")
// }

//perfect example of the above statment would be a traffic light of red, yellow, and green

// let x="red"
// let y="yellow"
// let z="Green"

// if (x){
//     console.log("Stop")
// }else if(y){
//    console.log("slow down")
// }else if(z) {
//   console.log("go")
// }else{
//   console.log("wrong color")
// }
